          <p class="blog-hding">Choosing the Right Flavor and Strength for You</p>
          <p>Finding the perfect nicotine pouch comes down to personal taste, nicotine needs, and your overall goals. Here are some tailored tips to help you choose:</p> 
          <p class="blog-sub-hding mt20px">For Beginners</p>
          <p>
            <b>Flavor:</b> Start with a mild, approachable flavor like Cool Mint or Citrus, which tend to be less intense and universally liked.<br/>
            <b>Strength:</b> Go for a low strength (3–6 mg) to ease into the experience without overwhelming effects. This allows you to assess how nicotine pouches feel and adjust the strength and session duration as needed.
           </p>
          <p class="blog-sub-hding mt20px">For People Transitioning from Smoking</p>
          <p>
            <b>Flavor:</b> If you're used to the taste of Tobacco, then Golden Tobacco, Coffee or spiced flavors might feel more familiar. Mint flavours can also work well for those who use menthol cigarettes.<br/>
            <b>Strength:</b> Moderate strength (9-12 mg) is generally a good starting point. If you are a heavy smoker, you may want to consider higher strengths, but you should try a moderate level first to see how it feels.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-sub-hding mt20px">For Former Vapers</p> 
          <p>
            <b>Flavor:</b> Fruit flavors, especially Berry and Tropical options like Blueberry and Watermelon, are popular among former vapers who enjoy sweeter profiles.<br/>
            <b>Strength:</b> Choose a strength that matches the nicotine levels you're used to from vaping. This can range from moderate (9-12 mg) to higher (15-20 mg) for heavy users.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-sub-hding mt20px">For Occasional or Social Nicotine Users</p>
          <p>
            <b>Flavor:</b> Consider fresher, lighter flavors like Fruit, Citrus, or Mint, which add a refreshing touch without being too intense.<br/>
            <b>Strength:</b> Stick to lower strengths (3-6 mg) to avoid excessive nicotine intake, especially if you don't use nicotine regularly.
          </p> 
          <p class="blog-sub-hding mt20px">Conclusion</p>
