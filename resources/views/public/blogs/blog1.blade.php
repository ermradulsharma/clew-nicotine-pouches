            <p class="blog-hding">What Are Nicotine Pouches?</p> 
            <p>   
            Nicotine pouches are tobacco-free nicotine delivery products that you place under your upper
(or bottom) lip. Unlike traditional tobacco products, you don't need to spit or chew with nicotine pouches. They provide a smoke-free and convenient alternative nicotine delivery.<br/><br/>
Nicotine pouches resemble small and slim, white fleece tea bags and fit comfortably between the lip and gum. They contain a blend of nicotine, plant fibers, flavorings, ph adjusters, and sometimes sweeteners.
<br/><br/>CLEW pouches offer a smooth mouthfeel while discreetly delivering nicotine absorbed into the bloodstream through the gum. They are available in a range of different flavors and strengths.

                 <p class="blog-hding">Preparing to Use Nicotine Pouches</p>
                 <p>Preparing to use nicotine pouches is important for
a safe and enjoyable experience. If you are a first-time user, choosing from the variety of flavors, the right nicotine strength and knowing
where to place the pouch correctly for a more comfortable fit can help you get the most out of
the experience.

                 <p class="blog-hding">Selecting the Best Nicotine Pouch For You</p>
                 <p>Within the CLEW collection, flavour choice comes down to individual preference. CLEW Nicotine pouches are available in various flavors to suit
every palate. Mint and Menthol options include Cool Mint, Peppermint, Spearmint, Freeze, and Wintergreen. There is a zingy Citrus
flavour and a robust Coffee. Fruity flavours include Blueberry and Watermelon and there is an
authentic smooth golden Tobacco flavour popular with smokers.<br/><br/>
When choosing the right nicotine strength, think about how much tobacco you use now. If you
are a heavy smoker, choose a higher strength. If you smoke lightly, start with a lower level. It can
help to try different strengths to see what feels comfortable. You want to balance the nicotine
experience with any tingling or strong feelings.
First-time users should always start with a lower strength (3-5mg) and increase the strength
only if needed.

                 <img src="../images/blog_10.jpg"/>
                 <p class="blog-hding">Catch a CLEW</p>
                 <p>
The CLEW cans consist of two sections: a main compartment that keeps the pouches fresh in a secure and airtight area, and a top compartment or catch-lid for storing used pouches when out and about.
<br/><br/>For the first use, you will need to use your nail to break the seal around the centre of the can.
Afterwards, you can simply open the can by squeezing the sides with your thumb and forefinger.</p>

            <div class="blogD-cnt">
                 <p class="blog-hding">Lock the Nicotine Pouch Between Your Lip and Gum</p>
                 <p>Gently insert the nicotine pouch between your upper lip and gum. Make sure it sits properly for a comfortable fit. Let the pouch rest without moving it too much.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="blogD-cnt">
            <p class="blog-hding">Enjoy the tingle</p>
            <p>
            As the CLEW pouch meets saliva, nicotine begins to be released and absorbed through the gum, and you will feel a tingling sensation, which some also refer to as a kick or hit. CLEW pouches have a sustained release, so the flavor and tingling sensations should not fade with the duration of your session.
            <br/><br/>
            If you are new to nicotine pouches, even though
you have used other nicotine products, we suggest you start with a CLEW pouch with a lower nicotine content (3-6mg) and only keep it in your mouth for 5-15 minutes. As you become more familiar with
the process and sensation, you can extend the
time you keep the pouch in your mouth to up to 45 minutes and adjust the nicotine strength as
you like.

            <div class="blogD-cnt">
            <p class="blog-hding">Withdraw the Pouch</p>
            <p>Once you have finished with your CLEW nicotine pouch, it is important to remove it from your mouth and dispose of it responsibly, especially in public areas or on publictransport. Do not flush them down the toilet. When there isn't a trash can nearby, youcan store used pouches in the small container in the catch lid.
                <br/><br/>
                Before recycling the plastic can, please remove any used pouches. Check local rules for the best disposal method in your area.

               <p class="blog-hding">How long should I keep a CLEW nicotine pouch in my mouth?</p>
               <p>CLEW Nicotine pouches can be held in the mouth for up to 45 minutes. They offer a sustained nicotine and flavour release for the whole 45-minute period. You can reduce the session length based on your preference and the nicotine strength chosen.</p>

            <div class="blogD-cnt">
              <p class="blog-hding">Are there any restrictions on nicotine pouch usage?</p>
              <p>CLEW pouches are small, discreet, and non-visible, so they can normally be used in all locations, including areas where smoking and vaping are prohibited, such as on public transport.
However, rules, regulations and age restrictions surrounding the purchase and use of nicotine
pouches do vary by territory to ensure that these products are used safely and responsibly.
Please check with your local authorities for confirmation in your area.<br/>For example, in the United
States, you must be 21 years old to buy nicotine pouches.

            <div class="blogD-cnt">
              <p class="blog-hding">Is it safe to use nicotine pouches daily?</p>
              <p>It is safe to use CLEW pouches daily as nicotine pouches are considered a safer alternative to smoking tobacco products. They do not involve combustion, which eliminates the harmful effects
of inhaling smoke.<br/>
However, nicotine pouches still contain the addictive chemical nicotine, so they are not riskfree. Like all nicotine products, these pouches must be used responsibly to avoid escalating
nicotine dependence. Overuse may lead to gum sensitivity or raised blood pressure, especially
when used in high concentrations or for prolonged periods. To keep nicotine pouch side effects
to a minimum, choose your strength carefully, especially if you are a first-time pouch user.</p>
